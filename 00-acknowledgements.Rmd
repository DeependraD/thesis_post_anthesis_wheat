I am indebted to the many individuals who have assumed the roles of advisor, mentor, and friend. Without their guidance and help this dissertation would never have had a shape of any kind. My advisor Dr. Madhav Prasad Pandey has offered his suggestions and professional insights throughout the course of experimentation and the write-up. I remain inspired by the energy and the efficiency with which our department and works any problem out. I would have neither set out for nor reached to the fruits of the field research without the help of NWRP, Bhairahawa, particularly that of senior scientist Mr. Nutan Raj Gautam, who kindly provided me with the wheat germplam used in the trial. \par
  
I owe thanks to my sisters Sangita and Suspa for helping me many days in the field take notes, or make observations as well as for their cheerful support. My mom remain a source of unflinching determination, to keep me focused and encouraged whenever I got grappled with distraught. Each of my post graduate school friends whom I have known since my days as undergraduate are very much thanked, for pushing me to continue every time I felt discouraged. \par
  
Finally, I am grateful for the support from my parents, extended family, friends, and some of my social media acquaintances who have left everlasting impression on my quest to discovery of knowledge. With computing as major engine in the writeup process, I have to thank the open-source advocates; They have contributed to the field of sciences, either by advancing the domain knowledge or by providing excellent tools for doing so. In summary, these two and a few decimal years have been a life long achivement in my journey into a bigger world.
