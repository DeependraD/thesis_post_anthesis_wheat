# Introduction

## Leaf health

- At phenotypic level, genotypes may be typed as healthy or not by assessing their signs and symptoms expressed in response to stress.

- Plant's performance given stress has often been ascribed to green and viable leaves contributing to photosynthesis during grain maturation in wheat [@thorne1982distribution]. 

- Post-anthesis foliar health could act as a proxy for determining final grain yield. It is implied in  the grain filling behavior of a plant. Ideally, the contribution of pre-anthesis photosynthetic reserves to the final grain yield has been found to stall around 5% to 10% [@sharma1992duration]. 

----

- Terminal leaves, particularly the flag leaf and the one directly below it, have significant contribution to genotypic variation in yield [@aslam1978photosynthesis; @rawson1983changes] with respect to provisioning of assimilate to functionally active parts of plants including the grain.

- The yield synthesis post-anthesis is mainly a function of leaf area duration, which in turn can be expressed in terms of leaf area index at anthesis and leaf longevity [@bingham1969physiological].

- Breeding programs might benefit for yield improvement by targeting indicators of plant's healthy leaf area, as well as the time dependent changes that prolong photosynthetic capacity of a leaf [@lupton1972further]. 

- The latter is often explained as the stay green(SG) trait-- indicative of leaf longevity and expressed as decline in photosynthetically active chlorophyllous surface [@joshi2007stay].

---

- In wheat, genotypic differences in SG have been reported to possess high heritability, with variation being controlled by relatively smaller number of alleles [@silva2001genetic].

- The maintenance of green coloration by plants enables them to maintain lower canopy temperatures [@kumari2013association] which may be less favorable for pathogens requiring relatively higher temperatures for faster growth and development.

- The SG trait is also implicated in genotypic variation conferring disease resistance, particularly those exhibiting foliar symptoms [@joshi2007stay].

- Study of leaf features--in terms of SG trait, foliar-disease resistance(assessed as levels of necrotic or chlorotic patches symptomatic of a pathogen), leaf area index(LAI), leaf waxyness and glaucousness-- might provide insights into yield determination processes that operate under field conditions.

----

## Spatial designs in field trials

- Presence of error variance characterizes biological systems.

- For a plant breeding program, **early testing** problem is to have to reliably discriminate among a large number of genetic resources.

- An augmented design is where a randomized design trial having a certain fraction of the plots allocated to check cultivar is augmented with entries in some optimized design framework with partial or no replication at all [@piepho_augmented_2016; @federer_augmented_1994].

- The **Augmented Row-Column Design**, a much later addition, are more flexible; they allow for arbitrarily large number of new cultivars to be tested, in a range of different numbers of rows and columns, and even allow for dealing with additional form of three way field heterogenity.

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

# HTML Widgets

I have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against **xaringan**. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.

Similarly, the Shiny mode (`runtime: shiny`) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.

See the next page for two HTML widgets.

---

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
```

---

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE}
DT::datatable(
  head(iris, 10),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

# Some Tips

- When you use the "Infinite Moon Reader" addin in RStudio, your R session will be blocked by default. You can click the red button on the right of the console to stop serving the slides, or use the _daemonized_ mode so that it does not block your R session. To do the latter, you can set the option

    ```r
    options(servr.daemon = TRUE)
    ```
    
    in your current R session, or in `~/.Rprofile` so that it is applied to all future R sessions. I do the latter by myself.
    
    To know more about the web server, see the [**servr**](https://github.com/yihui/servr) package.

- Do not forget to try the `yolo` option of `xaringan::moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        yolo: true
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

# Some Tips


.pull-left[
An example using a leading `*`:

    ```r
    if (TRUE) {
    ** message("Very important!")
    }
    ```
Output:
```r
if (TRUE) {
* message("Very important!")
}
```

This is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed.
]

.pull-right[
An example using `{{}}`:

    `r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
    if (TRUE) {
    *{{ message("Very important!") }}
    }
    ```
Output:
```{r tidy=FALSE}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

It is valid R code so you can run it. Note that `{{}}` can wrap an R expression of multiple lines.
]

---

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

````markdown
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````

Output:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

---

# Macros

- remark.js [allows users to define custom macros](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/80) (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...]` or `![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this)`. For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named `scale`:

    ```js
    remark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {
      var url = this;
      return '<img src="' + url + '" style="width: ' + percentage + '" />';
    };
    ```

    Then the Markdown text

    ```markdown
    ![:scale 50%](image.jpg)
    ```

    will be translated to
    
    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
    ```

---

# Macros (continued)

- To insert macros in **xaringan** slides, you can use the option `beforeInit` under the option `nature`, e.g.,

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          beforeInit: "macros.js"
    ```

    You save your remark.js macros in the file `macros.js`.

- The `beforeInit` option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before `remark.create()`. Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.

---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.name/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dojutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /??/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan) (?????????; the package name)

- The [moon reader](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (??????; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra) (?????????; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (????????????; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (????????????; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
