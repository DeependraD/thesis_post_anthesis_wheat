  abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Yecora 70) plants were grown with various concentrations of nitrate nitrogen available to the roots. Sampling of flag leaves began after they had reached full expansion and continued throughout senescence. Rates of gas exchange, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuP2) carboxylase activity, and the amounts of chlorophyll, soluble protein, nitrogen, and phosphorus were determined for each flag leaf. Rate of CO2 assimilation was uniquely related to total leaf nitrogen irrespective of nutrient treatment, season, and leaf age. Assimilation rate increased with leaf nitrogen, but the slope of the relationship declined markedly when leaf nitrogen exceeded 125 millimoles nitrogen per square meter. Chlorophyll content and RuP2 carboxylase activity were approximately proportional to leaf nitrogen content. As leaves aged, RuP2 carboxylase activity and calculated Hill activity declined in parallel. With normal ambient partial pressure of CO2, the intercellular partial pressure of CO2 was always such that rate of assimilation appeared colimited by RuP2 carboxylation and RuP2 regeneration capacity., The initial slope of rate of CO2 assimilation against intercellular partial pressure of CO2 varied nonlinearly with carboxylase activity. It is suggested that this was due to a finite conductance to CO2 diffusion in the wall and liquid phase which causes a drop in CO2 partial pressure between the intercellular spaces and the site of carboxylation. A double reciprocal plot was used to obtain an estimate of the transfer conductance.},

  doi = {10.2134/agronj2016.06.0325},
  abstract = {Augmented designs allow the testing of a large number of unreplicated entries. Replication of interspersed check cultivars according to a blocked design allows estimation of an error variance as well as local control for unreplicated entries. The most commonly used augmented designs use one-way blocking, but extensions have been suggested using blocking in rows and columns. We propose a flexible strategy to generate such designs, which is particularly suitable when the number of check cultivars is small. A salient feature of the approach is a grouping of adjacent rows and columns and the imposition of an additional blocking unit formed by the intersection of row and column groups. These superimposed blocking structures cater for an even distribution of replications for checks across the experimental field. We provide SAS code using the OPTEX procedure to generate such designs and discuss three examples illustrating the flexibility of the approach.},

Three generalizations of the designs for any n are presented with the statistical analysis procedures being given in detail for two of them. Formulae for the average variance of a difference between two unreplicated varieties is presented for three classes of designs. The effect of increasing n on the average variance is exhibited for two of the classes. Many of the designs are constructed to have the unreplicated plots surrounded by either 2, 3, or 4 replicated check varieties and to have roughly one-half or more of the plots allocated to unreplicated varieties. One member of this group of designs has been utilized in field experiments in Brazil.},

The present design was proposed to cope with such experimental conditions by using control plots to adjust for environmental heterogeneity. The structure is a split-plot design, where the whole-plots can be laid out in any standard design, but the arrangements of subplots is always 3 x 3 with the centre point used as a control. The shape of subplot needs to be square or nearly square, so that the distances between the centre plot and its corresponding eight test plots are relatively uniform. The control lines are assigned to the control plots according to the design specification for the whole-plots, and the test lines are assigned randomly to the noncontrol plots. The number of control plots under the present design is approximately 13-17\% of the total number of plots. The p x p Latin square is used as an example to demonstrate the basic idea of the design. Methods of analysis are also discussed.},
